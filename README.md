# Disinfection-Robot
[ICRA2024] This is the official repository of "Intelligent Disinfection Robot with High-Touch Surface Detection and Dynamic Pedestrian Avoidance" --[paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10610836)

We design a new disinfection robotic system with a high-touch area detection method and a dynamic pedestrian avoidance method. Both simulated and real-world experiments are conducted to demonstrate its effectiveness, especially in crowded indoor environments, such as hospitals.

We show the entire sanitization process in Sterilization process.mp4 and autonomous avoidance function for pedestrians in avoid-pedestrian.mp4. Video.mp4 is for testing.
